manage-credentials
==================

This role manages custom credential for Ansible Tower, ensuring that other components of the Ansible Tower configuration (e.g.: inventories) have access to what is needed.

## Requirements

A running Ansible Tower with admin permission level access.


## Role Variables

Check the top level [README](../README.md) for additional/common variables.

The variables used must be defined in the Ansible Inventory using the `ansible_tower.credentials` list as explained below.

| Variable | Description | Required | Defaults |
|:---------|:------------|:---------|:---------|
|ansible_tower.credentials.name|Name to be used for the credential|yes||
|ansible_tower.credentials.description|Description for the credential|no|nothing('')|
|ansible_tower.credentials.organization|Name of the existing org to tie these credentials with|yes||
|ansible_tower.credentials.type|Type of credentials ('machine', 'aws', etc)|yes||
|ansible_tower.credentials.inputs|Additional input parameters|no||


**_Note:_** Credential configuration will **only** happen if the `ansible_tower.credentials` portion of the dictionary is defined. Likewise, the installation expects this section to be "complete" if specified as it otherwise may error out.

**_Note:_** Credential input will **only** happen if the `ansible_tower.credentials.inputs` portion of the dictionary is defined and complete as per [Tower Credential Types documentation](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible-tower/latest/html/userguide/credentials.html#credential-types).


## Example Inventory

```yaml
---

ansible_tower:
  credentials:
  - name: "Cred1"
    description: "My Credential 1"
    organization: "Default"
    credential_type: "Machine"
  - name: "Cred2"
    description: "My Credential 2"

    credential_type: "Machine"
  - name: "Cred3"
    description: "My Credential 3"
    organization: "Default"
    credential_type: "Ansible Tower"
    inputs:
      host: "localhost"
      username: "my_user"
      password: 'my_password'
      verify_ssl: true
```
