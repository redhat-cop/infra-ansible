===============

This role manages Ansible Tower settings, ensuring that Ansible Tower configuration settings can be part of your playbook.

## Requirements

A running Ansible Tower with admin permission level access.


## Role Variables

Check the top level [README](../README.md) for additional/common variables.

The variables used must be defined in the Ansible Inventory using the `ansible_tower.settings` list as explained below.
