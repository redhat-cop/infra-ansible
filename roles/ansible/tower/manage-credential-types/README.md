manage-credential-types
=======================

This role manages custom credential types for Ansible Tower, ensuring the credential type(s) provided in the Ansible inventory exists with the properties specified in the Inventory

## Requirements

A running Ansible Tower with admin permission level access.


## Role Variables

Check the top level [README](../README.md) for additional/common variables.

The variables used to maintain the Credential Types must be defined in the Ansible Inventory using the `ansible_tower.credential_types` dictionary as explained below.

**_Note:_** Credential Types configuration will **only** happen if the `ansible_tower.credential_types` portion of the dictionary is defined. Likewise, the installation expects this section to be "complete" if specified as it otherwise may error out.
