This role manages Organizations for Ansible Tower, to be used with Ansible Tower runs.

## Role Variables

Check the top level [README](../README.md) for additional/common variables.

The variables used must be defined in the Ansible Inventory using the `ansible_tower.organizations` list as explained below.
