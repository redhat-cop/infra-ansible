config-ansible-tower-ocp
========================

This role is used to deploy and configure an Ansible Tower running as containers in OpenShift. This role is based on the existing Red Hat official sources to deploy Tower in OCP - [ansible-tower-openshift-setup-latest](https://releases.ansible.com/ansible-tower/setup_openshift/ansible-tower-openshift-setup-latest.tar.gz)

## Requirements

  - A running OpenShift Cluster and installed 'oc' client in the Ansible host


## Role Variables

The variables used to install Ansible Tower on OpenShift are outlined in the table below. 

**Note:** Authentication shall be based on either username/token. You can specify username and password and role will automatically retrieve token. Note that if a token is specified, the username/password will be ignored.

**Note:** As Tower Installer is based on Ansible playbooks, you may want to customize specific parts of it. You can copy over specific files by pointing to zip archive which contains new files along with the directory structure.

**Note:** Tower installer supports PostgreSQL deployment done in two way, EmptyDir and PVC based. If you choose EmptyDir be aware that PostgreSQL storage is not going to be persisted in any way. If you choose PVC, and the PVC doesn't exist, this playbook will automatically create a PVC(and underlying PV) based on default configuration of you clusters PV plugin. If PVC does exist, playbook will use it.

### Advanced Inventory Configuration 

| Variable | Description | Required | Defaults |

## Example Inventory

```yaml
---

ansible_tower:
  admin_password: 'admin'
  install:
    secret_key: 'abcdefghijkx'
    openshift:
      host: "https://api.crc.testing:6443"
      project: "test-tower"
      skip_tls_verify: "true"
      user: "kubeadmin"
      password: "XXXXX"

```

## Example Playbook

```yaml
---

- hosts: tower
  roles:
  - role: config-ansible-tower-ocp
```

## Tower Overrides

Variables in the installer playbook are found in several places and may change in future releases of the Tower installer:

- inventory 
- group_vars/all 
- roles/kubernetes/defaults/main.yml

Most variables are set through the included [inventory.j2](templates/inventory.j2) template. However, there are some advanced use cases which require overriding the `group_vars/all` file inside of the bundled Tower installer. This role is designed to allow new variables to be set through the inventory using the `tower_vars_overrides` dict.

For example, the Ansible Tower documentation recommends adding [custom virtual environments](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible-tower/3.8.1/html/administration/openshift_configuration.html#build-custom-virtual-environments) requires extending the ansible-tower-ocp base image and uploading the container image to your own repository. You can then override the `group_vars/all` file using a dict like the one below:

```yaml
tower_vars_overrides:
  kubernetes_awx_image: registry.redhat.io/ansible-tower-38/ansible-tower-rhel7
  kubernetes_awx_version: 3.8.1
  foo: bar
```

Note that existing variables will be replaced. New variables, such as `foo: bar` in the example above, will be appended to the end of the `group_vars/all` file if it does not already exist as a top level variable. Use with caution when replacing variables outside of the documented use cases.
