Check the top level [README](../README.md) for additional/common variables.

The variables used must be defined in the Ansible Inventory using the `ansible_tower.projects` list as explained below.

## Example Inventory

Example project containing playbooks for job templates:

```yaml
---

ansible_tower:
  admin_password: "admin01"
  projects:
  - name: "Job Template Project"
    description: "This project will be updated by Ansible Tower each time a job template is launched using a playbook from this project. May also contain inventory, however only playbook launches will update SCM"
    organization: "Default"
    scm_type: "git"
    scm_url: "https://github.com/redhat-cop/infra-ansible.git"
    scm_branch: "main"
    scm_credential_name: "my-credential"
    scm_update_on_launch: true
```
