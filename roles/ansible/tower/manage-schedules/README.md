manage-schedules
===============

This role manages Schedules for Ansible Tower, to be used with Ansible Tower runs.

## Requirements

A running Ansible Tower with admin permission level access.


## Role Variables

Check the top level [README](../README.md) for additional/common variables.

The variables used must be defined in the Ansible Inventory using the `ansible_tower.schedules` list as explained below.

| Variable | Description | Required | Defaults |
|:---------|:------------|:---------|:---------|
|ansible_tower.schedules.name|Name of the schedule|yes||
|ansible_tower.schedules.description|Description of the schedule|no||
|ansible_tower.schedules.rrule|Add a recurrence rule, AKA RRULE|yes||
|ansible_tower.schedules.enabled|enable/disable your schedule|no|yes|
|ansible_tower.schedules.unified_job_template|Name of template to run, which will translate to an integer ID|yes||


**_Note:_** Schedule configuration will **only** happen if the `ansible_tower.schedules` portion of the dictionary is defined. Likewise, the installation expects this section to be "complete" if specified as it otherwise may error out.


## Example Inventory

```yaml
---

ansible_tower:
  admin_password: "admin01"
