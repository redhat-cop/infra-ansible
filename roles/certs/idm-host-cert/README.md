idm-host-cert
=============

This ansible role is used to create host certificates, using the Red Hat IdM / FreeIPA as a Certificate Authority.

A certificate is created by adding the FQDN for the requested certificate as a host entry in the IdM/IPA, then the CSR is submitted to generate a host certificate. The host certificate, key and CA are all retrieved and can optionally be written to files specified in the inventory.

Requirements
------------

- An operational IdM/IPA account with the proper permissions to manage hosts.
