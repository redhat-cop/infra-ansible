Set of Roles
============

The ansible roles found in this directory are associated with prepping for a VNC (virtual network computing) server install and configuring a VNC server install.

First, if necessary, it preps the system for the install by installing firewalld and enabling it. Then it opens up firewall so that a network file system can be used. NOTE: this step can be skipped if a network file system is already in place. Afterwards, it installs additional packages, ensures the appropriate directories are in place, and sets up the VNC password. The final steps are modifying the start up scripts, user configs, and SELinux configs so that it can be used.

Requirements
------------

Python should be installed on the existing machine.
